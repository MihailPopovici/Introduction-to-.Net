What happens if you apply pagination after materializing the query with .ToList()? Why is this
problematic for large datasets?

If we call .ToList() first, the entire result set is loaded from the database into application memory before we slice it. For large tables this uses a lot of RAM, is slow, and can crash the process.
Correct approach: apply .Skip() and .Take() on the IQueryable and only then call .ToList(), so only the page subset is transferred to the app.
